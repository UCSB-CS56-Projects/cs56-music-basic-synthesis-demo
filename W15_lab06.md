README.md recommendations:

-Add an explanation of how ADSR notes are formed, and what they represent for people who do not understand music
-Add explanation of how program produces sound to help people understand how code works as it is currently very convoluted


Program Bugs:

-Show that Melody from file is not working currently with current build.xml
-Some ant tests are failing
-code only runs on CSIL machines (specific format crashes/doesn't work on other machines)

Suggested Solutions:

-To make program work on other machines, the program needs to check the hardware on the machine and select the right audio format based on its check


Test Coverage:

-4 of 13 ant tests are passing, the ones that are failing include the constructors, tostring, and getvolume/setvolume

Our Addition:

-We have developped a graph of the ADSR notes that models the characteristics of the ADSR note, and will redraw to the current specifications with a resized JFrame

TODO:

-Make adjustments dynamic (do not require changing size of screen)
-Make note size normalized (notes that are too long go off right side of screen)
-Add graph interactions to allow notes to adjust from moving the lines on the graph
